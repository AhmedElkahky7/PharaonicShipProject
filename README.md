Description
I’d like to share with you my graduation project from the "Digital Egypt" Initiative, which is a Pharaonic ship design created using 3ds Max under the supervision of Engineer Mohamed Mansour.

I worked on designing a ship inspired by ancient Egyptian heritage, aiming to reflect fine details that embody the Egyptian civilization. I drew inspiration for the shape of the ship from the serpent, an idea I got from the design of Tutankhamun's mask, as well as from the colors and motifs, like the blue color that the ancient Egyptians were the first to use.

I focused especially on carving intricate details into the ship’s hull, designing the sails, and simulating materials like gold, wood, and ropes, which were essential in their daily lives and boat-building techniques at that time.

The biggest challenge was to combine historical accuracy with personal creativity to make the piece visually appealing and authentic to the Egyptian civilization. I worked on every part of the project myself, without using any external assets.

The experience was full of challenges but gave me a real opportunity to learn and grow. I hope the work resonates with you and that I managed to convey a glimpse of the beauty and uniqueness of ancient Egyptian civilization.
